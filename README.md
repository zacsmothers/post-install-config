OsTicket after first launching has default options enabled that can be altered to fit an IT department or organization. As seen in the pictures above an Agent can be added to the OsTicket database and from there the Agent can have a specific Role assigned to them and they can be added to a specific Team and/or Department from within the Agent panel in the Admin window.

</p>
<p>
Many organizations or IT departments have Service Level Agreements(SLA) that set a ticket hierarchy, this can be done in the SLA section of the Manage panel in the Admin window by creating the specific criteria of which a ticket might be categorized, in the picture above this is done by SEV-A, SEV-B, and SEV-C.

  <h2>Help Topics Configuration</h2>

</p>
<p>
In the User directory section of the Users panel in the Agent window an Agent can register Customer accounts. In organizations where the customer can submit their own tickets, help topics can be created to help them submit a proper ticket so as not to submit a ticket with the wrong SLA this is done in the Help Topics section of the Manage panel in the Admin window.
